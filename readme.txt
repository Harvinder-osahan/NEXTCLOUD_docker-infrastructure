Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than virtual machines.

This Infrastructure has been created using the docker-compose.
It is a Multi-tier architecture.
It collaborates core docker concepts and takes,Networking, Volumes or Storage, Database, cloud service and it has been created on the top of Virtual machine Red hat.

Using this technique many tasks related to launching of servers, operating systems, applications can be done within seconds.

Docker whe combined with Kubernetese or Openshift can become a highly powerful tool for industrial usecases.
